## Introduction
As international students studying abroad, we have chosen this topic since it is closely related to our living standards and the way we live. Inflation measures how much more expensive a set of goods and services has become over a certain period (IMF), which is critical for us to manage the way we allocate money.

Exchange rate is important to us because we constantly face the need to be aware of the change in exchange rate as every single transaction we made is linked to the exchange rate at the time. Hence, both the inflation rate and the exchange rate are linked to our life and motivates us to investigate the correlation between them.
